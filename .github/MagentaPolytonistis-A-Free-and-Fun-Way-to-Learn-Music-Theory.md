Magenta-Polytonistis is a project by Google's Magenta team, which uses machine learning to create and explore new ways of making music. Polytonistis is a Greek word that means "many tones", and it refers to the ability to use multiple tonal centers in music. Magenta-Polytonistis allows you to experiment with different tonalities and harmonies by changing the root note, scale, mode, and chord of each key on your keyboard. You can also adjust the tempo, volume, and instrument of the sound.
 
Magenta-Polytonistis is not only a fun way to learn music theory, but also a creative tool for making music. You can record your own melodies and chords, and export them as MIDI files or audio files. You can also share your creations with others by generating a unique link that preserves your settings. You can even collaborate with other users by joining a live session and playing together in real time.
 
Magenta-Polytonistis is free and easy to use. You don't need to download or install anything, just open your web browser and go to [https://magenta.tensorflow.org/poly-tonistis](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/poly-tonistis). You can also watch this video tutorial to learn more about how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkx1aKv2z8o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkx1aKv2z8o).
 
If you are looking for a free and fun way to learn music theory, or if you just want to explore new musical possibilities, give Magenta-Polytonistis a try. You might be surprised by what you can create and discover.
  
Magenta-Polytonistis is based on the concept of polytonality, which is the use of more than one key or tonal center at the same time. Polytonality can create interesting and complex musical effects, such as contrast, tension, and ambiguity. Polytonality can also expand the range of emotions and moods that music can express.
 
Polytonality is not a new idea in music. It has been used by many composers throughout history, such as Bach, Mozart, Debussy, Stravinsky, and Bartok. However, polytonality is often considered a difficult and advanced topic in music theory, and it is not widely taught or practiced by most musicians. Magenta-Polytonistis aims to make polytonality more accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their musical background or skill level.
 
Magenta-Polytonistis is also a way to explore the potential of machine learning for music creation and education. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and perform tasks that are normally done by humans. Machine learning can help us discover new patterns, generate new ideas, and enhance our creativity. Magenta-Polytonistis uses machine learning to analyze the musical input from the user and provide feedback and suggestions. For example, it can highlight the notes that belong to the current scale or chord, or it can suggest alternative scales or chords that might sound good with the current melody.
